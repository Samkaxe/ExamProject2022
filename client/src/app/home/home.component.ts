    index3 : string = 'Yup,medical detection dogs are a thing. Because their sense of smell is so great, some dogs can be trained to sniff out medical conditions. They are used to diagnose a particular condition or to alert their owners if they need more medication. Some are even being trained to sniff out Covid-19!One of these incredible dogs is Medical Detection Dog Pal (pictured above), who was awarded the PDSA Order of Merit. Pal played a vital role in diabetic owner Claire’s life by alerting her of changes in her blood sugar.';

These 18 muscles allow dogs to move their ears in intricate ways, which is important to picking up sounds. Plus, your dogs ears can give you a clue as to how theyre feeling: If theyre laying flat back against their head, your pooch may be scared. If theyre pointing straight up, theyre alert and on the case. ';

And in April 2021, dog food company IAMS launched an app that uses this fact to help reunite lost pups with their owners. After you download NOSEiD, scan your pets nose and upload it to their database. If they ever escape your yard, any concerned human who finds them can search the app for a match.';

A 2015 study at Azabu University in Japan found an uptick in the level of oxytocin (sometimes known as "the love hormone") in both dogs and their owners when they stare at each other.';

In addition to being able to move in various ways, dogs ears are also able to detect much higher frequency sounds than human ears. In fact, dogs can hear sounds that are two times beyond our range—and it appears small dogs are actually better at it. According to Science Focus, thats because the smaller a mammals head is, the higher frequencies it can pick up and compare in each ear. Thats how they (and we) figure out where sounds are coming from.';
    index9 :string = 'Dogs mark their territory with glands in their paws. Dogs are not, in fact, trying to clumsily bury their poop when they scratch the ground after they go. They are just performing yet another territory-marking ritual. With the glands on their paws, they spread their scent and let other dogs know they are around. ';

Dogs being walked by men are four times more likely to attack and bite another dog. Why? Because dogs not only react to the behavior and posture of other dogs around them but also to people. ';
